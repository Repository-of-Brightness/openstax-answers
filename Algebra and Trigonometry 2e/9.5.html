    <p>Questions 4 to 12: Find all solutions on the interval \(0 \le \theta \lt 2\pi\)</p>
        <b>4. \(2\sin \theta = -\sqrt2\)</b>
            <p>\(2\sin \theta = -\sqrt2\)</p>
            <p>Divide both sides by 2 to get sine alone; isolate sine.</p>
            <p>\(\sin \theta = -{\sqrt2 \over 2}\)</p>
            <p>Since this is part of the Unit Circle, we can look at the unit circle for the answers when \(\theta = -{\sqrt2 \over 2}\). \(\theta\) refers to an angle.</p>
            <p>Or if we don't want to look at the Unit Circle, we can multiply both sides by \(\sin^{-1}\) to get rid fo the sine on the left side. That way we can find the angles for \(\theta\).</p>
            <p>Regardless, the answers would be \({3\pi}\over 4\) and \({5\pi}\over 4\)</p>
        <b>5. \(2\sin \theta = \sqrt3\)</b>
            <p>\(2\sin \theta = -\sqrt3\)</p>
            <p>Divide both sides by 2 to get sine alone; isolate sine.</p>
            <p>\(\sin \theta = {\sqrt2 \over 2}\)</p>
            <p>Since this is part of the Unit Circle, we can look at the unit circle for the answers when \(\theta = {\sqrt3 \over 2}\). \(\theta\) refers to an angle.</p>
            <p>Or if we don't want to look at the Unit Circle, we can multiply both sides by \(\sin^{-1}\) to get rid fo the sine on the left side. That way we can find the angles for \(\theta\).</p>
            <p>Regardless, the answers would be \({\pi}\over 3\) and \({2\pi}\over 3\)</p>
        <b>6. \(2\cos \theta = 1\)</b>
            <p>\(2\cos \theta = 1)</p>
            <p>Divide both sides by 2 to get sine alone; isolate cosine.</p>
            <p>\(\cos \theta = -{1 \over 2}\)</p>
            <p>Since this is part of the Unit Circle, we can look at the unit circle for the answers when \(\theta = {1 \over 2}\). \(\theta\) refers to an angle.</p>
            <p>Or if we don't want to look at the Unit Circle, we can multiply both sides by \(\cos^{-1}\) to get rid fo the cosine on the left side. That way we can find the angles for \(\theta\).</p>
            <p>Regardless, the answers would be \({\pi}\over 3\) and \({5\pi}\over 3\)</p>  
        <b>7. \(2\cos \theta = -\sqrt2\)</b>

            <p>Regardless, the answers would be \({3\pi}\over 4\) and \({7\pi}\over 4\)</p>  
        <b>8. \(\tan \theta = -1\)</b>
            <p>\(\tan \theta = -1\)</p>
            <p>Since this is part of the Unit Circle, we can look at the unit circle for the answers when \(\tan \theta = -1\). \(\theta\) refers to an angle.</p>
            <p>Or if we don't want to look at the Unit Circle, we can multiply both sides by \(\tan^{-1}\) to get rid fo the sine on the left side. That way we can find the angles for \(\theta\).</p>

        <b>9. \(\tan \theta = 1\)</b>
            <p>\(\tan \theta = 1\)</p>

            <p>Regardless, the answers would be \({\pi}\over 4\) and \({5\pi}\over 4\)</p>
        <b>10. \(\cot \theta + 1 = 0\)</b>
            <p>\(\cot \theta + 1 = 0\)</p>
            <p>Subtract one from both sides to make cotangent by itself; isolate cotangent.</p>
            <p>\(\cot \theta = -1\)</p>
            <p>Since tangent is \(1 \over \cot\), \(\tan = -1\) because \({1 \over -1} = -1\)</p>
            <p>\(\tan = 1\)</p>
